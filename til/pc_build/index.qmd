Looks damn good and it was damn hard, I really tried my best to double-check every decision on placement, installation and cable management, ended up having to rebuild a couple of times mainly because of the liquid cooler placement.

Overall I am really proud of what I achieved with 1568€, highlights on: 
- Liquid cooler AIO 360 pure loop2 fx reconditioned for half price only had very small bent fins, that's why I insisted so much in keeping it altought it made my life miserable (fan hub + pump on top). 
- Rtx 3090 2nd hand for 650€ (24gb VRAM great for training and fine tunning models). 
- Ryzen 7700 tray version for 200 €. 

I also think the build is quite upgradable in the future.
